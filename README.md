# The TODO list App

Written for the Real World Guide to TDD.

## Prereqs

There are two requirements - node and sqlite. On Linx and OS X you probably already have these, but if you dont you can install both here:

[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[SQLLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Setup

At this point you can get started pretty easily

```bash
cd todo
npm install
```

## Running the app
```
npm start
```

## Running tests

You will run tests won't you?

```bash
npm test
```
