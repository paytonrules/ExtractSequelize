# The TODO list App

Written for the Real World Guide to TDD.

## Prereqs

There are two requirements - node and sqlite. On Linx and OS X you probably already have these, but if you dont you can install both here:

[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[SQLLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Setup

There is a vagrant file you can use, You can use the Vagrant file (I assume) or setup stuff that is required

```bash
cd todo
npm install
```

## Running the app
```
npm start
```

## Running tests

You will run tests won't you?

```bash
npm test
```
